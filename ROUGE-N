How It Works:
Measures n-gram overlap between machine-generated and reference summaries.

Commonly used types:

ROUGE-1: Unigram overlap.

ROUGE-2: Bigram overlap.

ROUGE-L: Longest common subsequence.

Metrics Reported: Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

Application: Widely used in summarization benchmarks (e.g., DUC, CNN/DM datasets).
