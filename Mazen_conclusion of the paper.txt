in this paper, the authors came up with a faster and more efficient way to learn word embeddings, which are like vector representations of words. They introduced two models (CBOW)and (Skip-Gram) and both of them work really well even with huge amounts of text. The CBOW model predicts a word based on its context, while Skip-Gram does the opposite — it tries to predict the surrounding words from a given word. and even though the models are simple, they actually do a great job at capturing the meanings and relationships between words. For example, they can figure out that "king" minus "man" plus "woman" is close to "queen", which is pretty amazing. Overall, the paper showed that you don’t always need super complex models to get good results, and that it’s possible to train high-quality word vectors really efficiently.
